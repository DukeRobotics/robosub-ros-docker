# Dockerfile Notes
  
## Building

- Building should be done by the maintainer of the Dockerfile, and published so that others can follow the 'Running' instructions to use the image

1. ```cd``` into the directory containing the Dockerfile

2. Build
```bash
docker build -t dukerobotics/robosub-ros .
```
